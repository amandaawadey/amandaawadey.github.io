# Hello! My name is Amanda, and I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Columbia University. I am currently on the job market and expect to graduate in May 2023.

My primary research interests are in Development Economics, particularly on education and factors that hinder the growth of micro, small, and medium-sized firms in middle and low income countries.  

My work currently focuses on the intended and unintended impact of education reforms on human capital development and educational attainment. In my job market paper, I study the unintended effect of reforms resulting in increased cohort size and its subsequent impact on performance at the end of high school and the college education market. 

I obtained my Bachelor's degree at the University of Ghana (Summa cum laude)

For more information, please see my CV and get in touch with me at amanda.awadey@columbia.edu
