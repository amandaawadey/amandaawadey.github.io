The Intended and Unintended Effects of an Additional Year in Senior High School
Ongoing, Columbia University
 In this paper, I investigate the effects of an additional year in high schools on performance in the short term, and for college bound students, any persistent effects. This contributes to understanding the mechanisms of the established relationship between education and labor outcomes. Furthermore, changing the duration of senior high schools may have unintended impacts especially in environments where schooling is not free. In this study, I further explore potential unintended effects along with heterogenous impacts by socio-economic status and gender.
